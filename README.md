# Playing with Tests, GitHub Actions and Sonar in Javascript
This project is to provide examples of mocks, stubs, spies and e2e tests.
The example TDD folder is a TDD approach to a specific use case.

## Go to the each folder and look for the PACKAGE.JSON

```bash
npm install
```
Note that for mocks folder you just need

```bash
node index.test.js
```

This repository was created to provide some test examples in JavaScript and play with tools that we use in the real world like Sonar and GitHub Actions.
